    "# GRAPH MODELING\n",
    "## GRAPH COMPONENTS\n",
    "The Neo4j components that are used to define the graph data model are:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Nodes**\n",
    "- **Labels**\n",
    "- **Relationships**\n",
    "- **Properties**\n",
    "\n",
    "# Data modeling process\n",
    "Here are the **steps to create a graph data model**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the domain and define specific use cases (questions) for the application.\n",
    "- Develop the initial graph data model:\n",
    "- Model the nodes (entities).\n",
    "- Model the relationships between nodes.\n",
    "- Test the use cases against the initial data model.\n",
    "- Create the graph (instance model) with test data using Cypher.\n",
    "- Test the use cases, including performance against the graph.\n",
    "- Refactor (improve) the graph data model due to a change in the key use cases or for performance reasons.\n",
    "- Implement the refactoring on the graph and retest using Cypher.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types of models\n",
    "When performing the graph data modeling process for an application, you will need at least two types of models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data model\n",
    "- Instance model\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data model\n",
    "**The data model describes the labels, relationships, and properties for the graph.** It does not have specific data that will be created in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of a data model:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"./images/sample-data-model.png\"  width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "There is nothing that uniquely identifies a node with a given label. A graph data model, however is important because it defines the names that will be used for labels, relationship types, and properties when the graph is created and used by the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instance model\n",
    "An important part of the graph data modeling process is to test the model against the use cases. To do this, you need to have a set of sample data that you can use to see if the use cases can be answered with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example of an instance model:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img title=\"a title\" alt=\"Alt text\" src=\"./images/sample-data-instance-model.png\"  width=\"50%\">\n",
    "\n",
    "In this instance model, we have created some instances of Person and Movie nodes, as well as their relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling Nodes\n",
    "### node properties\n",
    "**Node properties are used to**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Uniquely identify a node.**\n",
    "- **Answer specific details of the use cases for the application.**\n",
    "- **Return data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modeling Relationships\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a relationship in Neo4j, a direction must either be specified explicitly or inferred by the left-to-right direction in the pattern specified. At runtime, during a query, direction is typically not required.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Properties for relationships\n",
    "Properties for a relationship are used to enrich how two nodes are related. When you define a property for a relationship, it is because your use cases ask a specific question about how two nodes are related, not just that they are related.\n",
    "\n",
    "# REFACTOR PROPERTIES AS NODE\n",
    "Here are the steps we use to refactor:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We take the property values for each Movie node and create a Language node.\n",
    "2. Then we create the IN_LANGUAGE relationship between that Movie node and the Language node.\n",
    "3. Finally, we remove the languages property from the Movie node.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the code to refactor the graph to turn the property values into nodes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MATCH (m:Movie)\n",
    "UNWIND m.languages AS language\n",
    "WITH  language, collect(m) AS movies\n",
    "MERGE (l:Language {name:language})\n",
    "WITH l, movies\n",
    "UNWIND movies AS m\n",
    "WITH l,m\n",
    "MERGE (m)-[:IN_LANGUAGE]->(l);\n",
    "MATCH (m:Movie)\n",
    "SET m.languages = null\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There will only be one node with the language value of English and we remove the languages property from all Movie nodes. This eliminates a lot of duplication in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "# PROFILE \n",
    "You can use the PROFILE keyword to see the performance for a query.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "PROFILE MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]-()\n",
    "WHERE p.born < '1950'\n",
    "RETURN p.name\n",
    "```\n",
    "# EXPLAIN\n",
    "```\n",
    "EXPLAIN MATCH (m:Movie)\n",
    "WHERE  m.title STARTS WITH 'Toy Story'\n",
    "RETURN m.title, m.released\n",
    "```\n",
    "This query produces the execution plan where the first step is NodeIndexSeekByRange. In this case an index will be used because it is defined in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The difference between using `EXPLAIN` and `PROFILE` is that `EXPLAIN` provides estimates of the query steps where `PROFILE` provides the exact steps and number of rows retrieved for the query.** \n",
    "\n",
    "# PATTERNS\n",
    "A `pattern` is a **combination of nodes and relationships that is used to traverse the graph at runtime**. You can write queries that test whether a pattern exists in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)\n",
    "WHERE  p.name = 'Tom Hanks'\n",
    "AND exists {(p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)}\n",
    "RETURN p.name, labels(p), m.title\n",
    "```\n",
    "## NON PATTERNS\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a scenario where using `exists { }` for a pattern is useful. You use `NOT exists { }` to exclude patterns in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to find all the movies that Tom Hanks acted in, but did not direct.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "MATCH (p:Person)-[:ACTED_IN]->(m:Movie)\n",
    "WHERE  p.name = 'Tom Hanks'\n",
    "AND NOT exists {(p)-[:DIRECTED]->(m)}\n",
    "RETURN  m.title\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# IMPORT DATA\n",
    "Cypher has a built-in clause, LOAD CSV for importing CSV files. If you have a JSON or XML file, you must use the APOC library to import the data, but you can also import CSV with APOC. And the Neo4j Data Importer enables you to import CSV data without writing any Cypher code.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The types of data that you can store as properties in Neo4j include:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- String\n",
    "- Long (integer values)\n",
    "- Double (decimal values)\n",
    "- Boolean\n",
    "- Date/Datetime\n",
    "- Point (spatial)\n",
    "- StringArray (comma-separated list of strings)\n",
    "- LongArray (comma-separated list of integer values)\n",
    "- DoubleArray (comma-separated list of decimal values)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways that you can import CSV data into Neo4j that you will learn in this course:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Using the Neo4j Data Importer.\n",
    "2. Writing Cypher code to perform the import.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must have one or more CSV files that represent the nodes and relationships that will be created in the graph. You must also have an existing Neo4j DBMS that is started. You typically start with a graph that has nothing in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## import data - CSV \n",
    "\n",
    "A CSV file represents rows of data that could be exported from relational and other databases, Web APIs, and other sources. When you are given CSV files, you must determine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Whether the CSV file will have header information, describing the names of the fields.\n",
    "- What the delimiter will be for the fields in each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "Including headers in the CSV file reduces syncing issues and is a recommended Neo4j best practice.\n",
    "\n",
    "If the source CSV files use a different field terminator, you must specify the `FIELDTERMINATOR` in your Cypher LOAD CSV clause.\n",
    "\n",
    "**If the headers do not correspond to the data representing the fields, you cannot load the data**. \n",
    "\n",
    "You must also know whether you can assume the use of the default delimiter \",\", otherwise, you will need to use the `FIELDTERMINATOR` keyword along with LOAD CSV when you use Cypher to import the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "You should have a local copy of the CSV files so you can inspect the data in them. In fact, **when using the Neo4j Data Importer you will need a local copy of the CSV files**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### NORMALIZED DATA\n",
    "Data normalization is common in relational models. **This enables you to have CSV files that correspond to a relational table where an ID is used to identify the relationships**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### DE-NORMALIZED DATA\n",
    "With de-normalized data, **the data is represented by multiple rows corresponding to the same entity**, which will be loaded as a node. The difference, however, is that de-normalized data typically **represents data from multiple tables in the RDBMS**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ID UNIQUE\n",
    "When you load data from CSV files, you rely heavily upon the IDs specified in the file. **A Neo4j best practice is to use an ID as a unique property value for each node.** If the IDs in your CSV file are not unique for the same entity (node), you will have problems when you load the data and try to create relationships between existing nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## import data - NEO4J DATA-IMPORTER\n",
    "\n",
    "You can import or export your mappings to a JSON file or to a ZIP file if you also want to include the CSV files.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Importer is good for small to medium datasets(**less than 1M rows**), but if you have a large dataset, you will need to use Cypher to import the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Data Importer is a generalized app as you saw that creates all properties in the graph as strings, integers, decimals, datetimes, or boolean, and you need to possibly post-process or refactor the graph after the import.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Requirements for using the Data Importer\n",
    "- You must use **CSV** files for import.\n",
    "- CSV files must reside **on your local system** so you can load them into the graph app.\n",
    "- CSV data must be **clean** (you learned this in an earlier lesson).\n",
    "- **IDs must be unique for all nodes** you will be creating.\n",
    "- The CSV file must have **headers**.\n",
    "- The DBMS must be **started**.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Step 1: Placing the CSV file(s) on your local system and ensure they have headers and are clean.\n",
    "- Step 2: Opening the Neo4j Data Importer\n",
    "- Step 3: Loading the CSV files on your local system into the graph app\n",
    "- Step 4: Examining the CSV header names used in the CSV files\n",

    "- Step 6: Defining mapping details for the node\n",
    "- Step 7: Creating the relationships between nodes\n",
    "- Step 8: Defining the mapping details for the relationship\n",
    "- Step 9: Performing the import\n",
